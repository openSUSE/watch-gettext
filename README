watch-gettext is a tool to watch origins of translation in applications.

It writes log to watch-gettext-{program_name}.po. If it exists, it writes
watch-gettext-{program_name}-{pid}.po.

Unless WATCH_GETTEXT_DIR is defined, it writes to the current directory.

Usage: watch-gettext executable [arguments of the executable]

Note: You may experience strange warnings with this application. For example GTK+ applications complain:
Whoever translated default:LTR did so wrongly.

You can ignore this message. This is caused by mangling of translations with special meaning.
